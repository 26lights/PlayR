This tutorial will try to analyze the Play'R tutorial application and explain the associated API and functions.

A good start is to open the ``playr-tutorial`` project in your favorite editor and navigate through the different controllers starting from the ``Application`` object.

At the same time, you can run the application with ``sbt run`` and use your favorite ReST tool to play with the available resource.
